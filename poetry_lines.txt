I {verb1} by the {noun1}
Of this desolate {noun1}
Where {noun1} cries in the {noun2}
Until the {noun1} {verb1}s
And {noun1} {verb1} in the deep
The {noun1} of {noun2} and {noun3}
And the {noun1} of {noun2} is {adjective1},
Your {noun1} will not lie by the {noun2}
So I may but {verb1} {adjective1};
Thus to {verb1} me by {noun1}
Is the {noun2} of {noun1}
What needs twenty {noun1}s, when one
When we first {verb1}, his {noun1} {verb2}s our own
When {noun1} changes to {noun2} we can {verb1}
What was the {noun1} for which you would {verb1}
